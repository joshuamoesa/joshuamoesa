### Hey, I'm [Joshua Moesa](https://joshuamoesa.com)! ‚úå

As a senior consultant working for Rubix, I'm tackling enterprise application integration challenges at scale. Currently focused on augmenting data using big data analysis tools and practices. Integration-nerd. Dutch. Child of the 80s. Dad of twins. . ‚ú®üòç

### What I'm working on üë®‚Äçüíª

Currently I'm architecting and implementing the mission-critical Parcels & Logistics integration platform using cloud-native technologies like TIBCO BusinessWorks Container edition, AWS ECS Fargate and Docker. Building in Observability with AWS CloudWatch, Splunk, Datadog and big data analysis practices. Ensuring that integration solutions running as internal APIs work perfectly and deliver the best experience. Working with colleagues in technology and business roles to provide a consensus-based solution that is scalable, adaptable and in synchronization with changing business needs using hybrid integration practices. Ultimate goal is leveraging the platform to help PostNL gain footprint as the logistics and postal solutions provider.

Areas of focus: TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition, TIBCO Messaging (EMS, FTL), AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, GO, Java, Docker, Splunk, DataDog
